> i have a problem with my code block markown processing, i implemented to use my layout item_code_block but it 
  doesnt work as i wanted, it appears the default code block from markown and the item code block under the 
  response it doesnt evenn get placed where it should be and when the ai response is done generating all the code 
  blovks dissapears and there remains only these harcoded text [CODE_BLOCK_1], [CODE_BLOCK_2] and so on. Make for 
  the code blocks to use my layout and to stay there where it shoud not to get separated at the buttom of the 
  response, ultrathink

✻ Thinking…

  The user has a problem with their markdown code block processing. They implemented a custom layout 
  item_code_block but it's not working as expected. The issues are:

  1. The default markdown code block is appearing
  2. Their custom layout appears under the response instead of where it should be placed
  3. When the AI response is done generating, all code blocks disappear and only hardcoded text like 
  [CODE_BLOCK_1], [CODE_BLOCK_2] remain

  They want the code blocks to use their custom layout and stay in place where they should be, not get separated at
   the bottom of the response.

  This is a complex task that involves understanding their current markdown processing implementation and fixing 
  it. I should use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task since it's multi-step and complex.

  Let me first explore the codebase to understand how they're currently handling markdown processing and code 
  blocks.

● I'll help you fix the code block markdown processing. Let me first explore your current implementation to
  understand the issue.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  [ ] Analyze current markdown processing implementation         
     [ ] Examine the custom item_code_block layout
     [ ] Find where code blocks are being replaced with placeholders
     [ ] Fix the code block rendering to use custom layout in place
     [ ] Test the fix to ensure code blocks stay in correct position
