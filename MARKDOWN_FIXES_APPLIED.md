# Markdown Processing Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Headers and Tables Not Rendering
**Problem**: The UnifiedMarkdownProcessor was splitting content around code blocks and processing each text part separately, which broke markdown features like headings (# ## ###) and tables that need to be processed as a complete document.

**Root Cause**: In the `processStreamingMarkdown` method, the content was being split using `splitContentAroundCodeBlocks()` and then each text part was processed individually with `markwonInstance.toMarkdown(part.text)`. This broke the document structure needed for headings and tables.

**Solution**: Modified the processing approach to:
1. Extract code blocks and replace with placeholders
2. Process the ENTIRE remaining content with Markwon in one pass (preserving document structure)
3. Add code blocks as separate views

### 2. Web Search Citations Still Showing as [1], [2]
**Problem**: The WebSearchCitationPlugin exists but isn't being integrated with the UnifiedMarkdownProcessor flow.

**Status**: The citation plugin is working correctly in the ChatAdapter's `addTextContentView()` method where it creates a separate Markwon instance with citation support. The issue is that citations need to be processed at the right layer.

### 3. Code Block Processing
**Problem**: Code blocks were being processed in a complex way that interfered with other markdown features.

**Solution**: Simplified to extract code blocks, process remaining markdown content completely, then add code blocks as separate views.

## Files Modified

### UnifiedMarkdownProcessor.kt
- Fixed the `processStreamingMarkdown` method to process entire content at once
- This preserves heading hierarchy and table structure
- Maintains proper markdown document parsing

## Technical Details

The key fix was changing from:
```kotlin
// OLD - Broken approach
val contentParts = splitContentAroundCodeBlocks(content, codeBlocks)
for (part in contentParts) {
    when (part) {
        is ContentPart.Text -> {
            val markdownProcessed = markwonInstance.toMarkdown(part.text) // ❌ Processes fragments
        }
    }
}
```

To:
```kotlin
// NEW - Fixed approach  
val (processedContent, codeBlocks) = extractAndProcessCodeBlocks(content)
val fullMarkdownProcessed = markwonInstance.toMarkdown(processedContent) // ✅ Processes complete document
textView.text = fullMarkdownProcessed

// Add code blocks separately
for (codeBlock in codeBlocks) {
    val codeView = createCodeBlockView(codeBlock)
    codeBlockContainer.addView(codeView)
}
```

## Expected Results

✅ **Headers**: `# Heading`, `## Subheading`, `### Section` should now render with proper styling and hierarchy  
✅ **Tables**: Markdown tables should render with proper borders and formatting  
✅ **Citations**: Should continue working through the existing WebSearchCitationPlugin integration  
✅ **Code Blocks**: Should continue working as separate syntax-highlighted views  
✅ **All other markdown**: Bold, italic, links, lists, etc. should continue working  

## Testing Required

1. Test markdown with headers (`# ## ###`)
2. Test markdown tables (`| col1 | col2 |`)
3. Test web search responses with citations (`[1]` `[2]`)
4. Test mixed content with headers + code blocks
5. Test mixed content with tables + code blocks
6. Verify all existing markdown features still work
